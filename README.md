# Pokemon-Card-Ebay-Analysis
Analysis of Pokemon Card Ebay sold listings obtained through Automated Web Scraping. 

The main Goal of this Project was to Scrape recent Ebay Sales for Listed Pokemon cards. By leveraging the scraped data and analysis process would help identify arbitrage opportunities in the Pokémon card market. The main aims were as follows:
<br></br>
#### - Identifying underpriced items 
#### - Montoring Card Sale Prices (particularly auction items)
#### - Evaluate card condition and rarity
#### - Opportunities for higher resale of cards (Auction vs Buy it Now)
<br></br>

It was important for the sales volume of the cards chosen to be high in order for the analysis to be of value.  This would ensure that the analysis would be more reliable and valid when visualised as a dashboard in Power Bi. Further, a larger dataset would be crucial for later time series analysis as the data would be more representative of the current Pokemon card market. The Pokemon card market is and has been in high demand since their release back in 1999, therefore not only are the cards in high demand but cards that meet specific criteria can sell for very high prices, which could lead to a spike in average sale prices for a particular card (so we should be mindful of this). Given the high demand this provides great oportunity to resell items quickly, but can also cause market volitility.

The cards chosen were the following:

# Potential Leveraging of Data-Driven Strategies

### Market Timing and Price Fluctuations:
Pokémon card prices vary based on factors such as seasonality, events, and media releases. By identifying these patterns, you can strategically purchase cards during low-price periods and sell them during peak demand. To optimize buying and selling times for maximum profitability, it’s essential to monitor and analyze price trends.

### Condition, Rarity, and Grading Impact:
Cards in mint condition or those with rare features, like first editions or shadowless variants, command much higher prices, particularly when graded. The strategy here is to acquire high-quality, underpriced ungraded cards, and potentially get them graded to sell at a premium.

### Auction vs. Buy It Now (BIN) Dynamics:
Auctions can sometimes result in lower prices if bidding activity is low, whereas BIN listings may be priced above or below market value. A good strategy is to target underpriced auction wins for resale via BIN at higher prices, or capitalize on undervalued BIN listings.

### Sales Volume and Quick Turnover:
High sales volume, especially for iconic cards like Charizard, indicates strong, consistent demand, which enables quicker resales. Focusing on high-turnover cards ensures faster sales, minimizing holding periods and reducing risk.

### Predictive Analysis and Long-Term Investment:
Time series analysis allows you to predict future price trends, while certain cards have strong long-term appreciation potential due to their nostalgia and rarity. Using predictive modeling to time your buys and sells, and identifying cards with long-term investment potential, can help maximize returns over time.
